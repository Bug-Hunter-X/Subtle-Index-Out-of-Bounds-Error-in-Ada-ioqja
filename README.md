This example showcases a common, yet subtle, error in Ada programming. The core issue lies in using an Integer loop index while accessing an array with a subtype.  The `Positive_Index` subtype is intended to provide bounds checking, but the second loop iterates with `Integer`, bypassing the subtype protection. This can lead to unexpected runtime errors if the loop index goes beyond 10.  The solution demonstrates the importance of consistency in using subtypes when accessing array elements.
